Dear Princess Celestia: Advent of Code Day 2!

Today I learned about navgiation!

I learned how to find my position using the many numbers for depth and the
many numbers for position to get my position!

Did you know that the final depth has the numbers 1

Then you get my position! That's all about how to find a submarine depth!

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
